      <h1 class="w3-center">About Girls Who Code</h1><br>
      <h5 class="w3-center">Tradition since 2012</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">Girls Who Code was founded by Reshma Saujani in 2012 who came up with the idea of creating the organization during her run for the United States Congress when she noticed that schools along her campaign route lacked girls in computer science classrooms.The organization runs programs during the academic year teaching high school girls computing skills like programming, robotics, and web design, with sessions including projects and trips to companies like Twitter and Facebook. There are now over 150 Girls Who Code clubs across America and the organization aims to teach one million girls to code by 2020. By December 2014, three thousand students had completed a Girls Who Code program, 95% of whom went on to major in computer science at university.
